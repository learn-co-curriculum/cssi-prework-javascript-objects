# JavaScript Objects
JavaScript is an object oriented programming language. Everything can be described by objects, which bundle properties with methods and events that impact those objects.

An object is a list of associated data pairs. Unlike arrays, objects do not have numbered indexes. Instead they contain key names and associated values. Where a numbered grocery list is a good metaphor for an array, a birthday list including a personâ€™s name (key) and their birthday month value) would be a better metaphor for an object.

```
> var birthdays = { "Homer" : "August", "Marge": "October"}
```


Objects are like an unordered list of pairs. The syntax is different, too.

```
> var fruitColors = { "apple" : "red", "tangerine": "orange", "banana": "yellow"}
```
`apple` is the key, and the associated value is `red`


You can find a value by indexing an object using the key.
```
> fruitColors["apple"]
You will get an error if you ask for something that doesn't exist.
> fruitColors["pear"]
```
Javascript also allows you to access the values by using dot notation.

```
> fruitColors.tangerine
```

You can also reassign values.

`fruitColors["apple"] = "green"`

Finally, you can use Object.keys() to list all of the keys in an object.
`Object.keys(fruitColors)`


## Methods in JavaScript Objects
In real life, a person is an object. A person has **properties** like firstName, surname, age, and gender. A person's ability to express her thoughts can be defined as a **method** _talk_. These properties will be the keys to our person object.

Object  | Property Name        | Property Value                    | Method |
----------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------|
person | firstName                | person.firstName = "Jane" |
            | surname                 | person.surname = "Doe"    |
            | age                         | person.age = 24                 |
            | gender                    | person.gender = "Female" |
            |                                |                                            | person.talk();


Using this representation of person, every person object in JavaScript will have the same property names (firstName, surname, age, and gender) **BUT** different property values. Each person object would also have a method _talk_.

Let's fill out the profile of our `person object` to match the information in the object table above:

```javascript
      var person = {
        firstName: "Jane",
        surname: "Doe",
        age: 24,
        gender: "Female",
        talk : function() {
         return "Hello, my name is "+ this.firstName;
         }
        }
```

To access the value inside our person object, you can use dot notation or index the object using the key for the property you want.

```javascript
>person.firstName
Jane
>person["age"]
24
```

To use a method within the object, just use dot notation.
```javascript
>person.talk()
"Hello, my name is Jane"
```
